It is by no means clear whether the attempted assasination of Premier Gamal Adbel Nasser was engineered by General Mohammed Naguib or by Nasser himself as a move against Naguib. Whatever the truth of the assassination plot, it served as the backdrop od the dismissal of Naguib from the presidency of Egypt. Premier Nasser has held the actual reigns since King Farouk was ousted in July, 1952, but Naguib for most of the time has been the front man. For a while after the departure of the King, many persons thought that Naguib was the man with the power, and he was adored by the Egyptian people. But all along it was Nasser and the Revolution Command Council of the army that wielded the authority. When Naguib realized what a large following he had, he presumed to question their authority, and the result now is dismissal for the second time this year.
Premier Nasser has shown a remarkable capacity to govern in the two and a half years that he has held the reins of power. Some of the economic reforms have been successful. He has prevented a situation that might easily have ended in civil war from worsening and he has fended off the powerful and fanatical Moslem Brotherhood. He worked out a satisfactory agreement with the British for control of the Suez - though regrettably there still is no approach to settlement with Israel. Despite the official criticism of the United States policy in the Near East, Nasser has welcomed American technical aid and has cooperated with American economic officials. If he can survive the crisis over the dismissal of Naguib, he and his military junta may be able to provide the country with a relatively stable and responsive government.
